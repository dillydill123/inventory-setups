Need to add a prefix to layouts
 - Add >>>invsetup<<< to indicate it comes from inventory setup plugin
 - Could use the hash afterwards? Is it worth doing that? banktags.layout_>>>invsetup<<<_<<hash>> would be the key
 - In Data manager, we can check for layouts that don't exist anymore.
   - Gather all banktags.layout* and remove ones that don't have >>>invsetup<<<.
   - Go through all inventory setups. Check if a config key for banktags.layout_>>>invsetups<<<_<hash_of_name> exists. If so, remove from the list
   - Any remaining config keys with >>>invsetups<<< must be old ones and can be deleted.
 - Function to get layout key.
Add Config Option for Default Layout
Add Preset Layout
Setup Deleted
 - Remove the layout with layoutManager, Remove the tag as well
Setup Refreshed.
  - Redo the layout from scratch using preset or zigzag.
Setup Added
 - Create a layout with preset or zigzag and save it. Also create a tag.
Setup name Changed
 - Get the layout, remove the old layout and tag, and save a new layout and tag with the new name.
Helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout
 - Remove the setup tag
 - Collect all items in the inventory setup and IDs (including variation mappings if they exist).
 - Add each item to the recreated tag (be sure not to override fuzzy. If a previous item had it before we should make sure it does not get set to False)
 - Go through the existing layout and remove any IDs that are not part of the setup Ids.
 - Go through each of the setup IDs and make sure the layout has at least one copy. If not, add one to the layout.
Item fuzzy toggled
 - Use helper function to recalculate items in the layout as shown above.
Items Changed in a Setup
 - Need to handle removed and added.
 - Need to handle changed by slot and changed by search.
 - I think the helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout will take care of this as well.
   - For remove, should we remove the first instance of the item in the layout? Not currently done.
Overwrite layout
 - Add option in additional worn items to overwrite layout. Also overwrite the tag.
 - Remove tag and then recreate it. Save layout to overwrite it.
 - Add confirm option

^^^ DONE ^^^
vvv TODO VVV

Start Bank Tags Plugin on startup
  - What about Hub BTL? How should it be handled?
  - Bug when turning on bank tags while tab is opened? Can't reproduce.
  - Handle situations where Bank Tags isn't on
    - Auto layout option hide.
Add ZigZag default layout
Migrate Bank Tag Layout data to core layout data on first time using the plugins.
  - How? Adam Layouts has a conversion.
  - Use a key to indicate if the conversion has happened before.
Importing a Setup + Layout
 - Maybe create an InventorySetupPortable? which has a layout object and a InventorySetup object. Can serialize that instead.
 - Maybe could also support old format.
Exporting a Setup + Layout
 - Use InventorySetupPortable idea from above?
Add ability to export tag that core bank tags can read.

Make sure all TODOs are taken care of
Item Removed from Setup
