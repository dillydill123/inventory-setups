Need to add a prefix to layouts
 - Add >>>invsetup<<< to indicate it comes from inventory setup plugin
 - Could use the hash afterwards? Is it worth doing that? banktags.layout_>>>invsetup<<<_<<hash>> would be the key
 - In Data manager, we can check for layouts that don't exist anymore.
   - Gather all banktags.layout* and remove ones that don't have >>>invsetup<<<.
   - Go through all inventory setups. Check if a config key for banktags.layout_>>>invsetups<<<_<hash_of_name> exists. If so, remove from the list
   - Any remaining config keys with >>>invsetups<<< must be old ones and can be deleted.
 - Function to get layout key.
Add Config Option for Default Layout
Add Preset Layout
Add ZigZag Layout
Setup Deleted
 - Remove the layout with layoutManager, Remove the tag as well
Setup Refreshed.
  - Redo the layout from scratch using preset or zigzag.
Setup Added
 - Create a layout with preset or zigzag and save it. Also create a tag.
Setup name Changed
 - Get the layout, remove the old layout and tag, and save a new layout and tag with the new name.
Helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout
 - Remove the setup tag
 - Collect all items in the inventory setup and IDs (including variation mappings if they exist).
 - Add each item to the recreated tag (be sure not to override fuzzy. If a previous item had it before we should make sure it does not get set to False)
 - Go through the existing layout and remove any IDs that are not part of the setup Ids.
 - Go through each of the setup IDs and make sure the layout has at least one copy. If not, add one to the layout.
Item fuzzy toggled
 - Use helper function to recalculate items in the layout as shown above.
Items Changed in a Setup
 - Need to handle removed and added.
 - Need to handle changed by slot and changed by search.
 - Additional filtered items need to be handled because they are a map instead of array.
 - I think the helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout will take care of this as well.
   - For remove, should we remove the first instance of the item in the layout? Not currently done.
Overwrite layout
 - Add option in additional worn items to overwrite layout. Also overwrite the tag.
 - Remove tag and then recreate it. Save layout to overwrite it.
 - Add confirm option
Mass importing setups + layout
Exporting a Setup + Layout
 - Use InventorySetupPortable
Mass exporting setups + layouts
 - Export list of InventorySetupPortables
Importing a Setup + Layout
 - Create an InventorySetupPortable which has inventory setup serializable and layout info.
 - When importing, need to add items in the setup to the tag after it's been processed, since we are only saving the layout.
 - Not supporting old format.


^^^ DONE ^^^
vvv TODO VVV


Add ability to export tag that core bank tags can read.
Hub BTL disable
  - "use with inventory setups" config option turn off programmatically 
Start Bank Tags Plugin on startup
  - Or alternatively add a panel saying bank tags is not on, please turn it on.
  - Bug when turning on bank tags while tab is opened? Can't reproduce.
Handle Situations where Bank Tags isn't on
  - Auto layout option in worn items needs to be hidden.
  - Chat message when trying to filter the bank.
  - Panel indicating bank tags is off and is required to use some features of inventory setups on startup.
Migrate Bank Tag Layout data to core layout data on first time using the plugins.
  - How? Adam Layouts has a conversion. https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/banktags/tabs/TabInterface.java#L521
  - Use a key to indicate if the conversion has happened before.
