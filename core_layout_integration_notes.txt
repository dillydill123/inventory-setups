Need to add a prefix to layouts
 - Add >>>invsetup<<< to indicate it comes from inventory setup plugin
 - Could use the hash afterwards? Is it worth doing that? banktags.layout_>>>invsetup<<<_<<hash>> would be the key
 - In Data manager, we can check for layouts that don't exist anymore.
   - Gather all banktags.layout* and remove ones that don't have >>>invsetup<<<.
   - Go through all inventory setups. Check if a config key for banktags.layout_>>>invsetups<<<_<hash_of_name> exists. If so, remove from the list
   - Any remaining config keys with >>>invsetups<<< must be old ones and can be deleted.
 - Function to get layout key.
Add Config Option for Default Layout
Add Preset Layout
Add ZigZag Layout
Setup Deleted
 - Remove the layout with layoutManager, Remove the tag as well
Setup Refreshed.
  - Redo the layout from scratch using preset or zigzag.
Setup Added
 - Create a layout with preset or zigzag and save it. Also create a tag.
Setup name Changed
 - Get the layout, remove the old layout and tag, and save a new layout and tag with the new name.
Helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout
 - Remove the setup tag
 - Collect all items in the inventory setup and IDs (including variation mappings if they exist).
 - Add each item to the recreated tag (be sure not to override fuzzy. If a previous item had it before we should make sure it does not get set to False)
 - Go through the existing layout and remove any IDs that are not part of the setup Ids.
 - Go through each of the setup IDs and make sure the layout has at least one copy. If not, add one to the layout.
Trim Layout helper function
Item fuzzy toggled
 - Use helper function to recalculate items in the layout as shown above.
Items Changed in a Setup
 - Need to handle removed and added.
 - Need to handle changed by slot and changed by search.
 - Additional filtered items need to be handled because they are a map instead of array.
 - I think the helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout will take care of this as well.
   - For remove, should we remove the first instance of the item in the layout? Not currently done.
Overwrite layout
 - Add option in additional worn items to overwrite layout. Also overwrite the tag.
 - Remove tag and then recreate it. Save layout to overwrite it.
 - Add confirm option
Mass importing setups + layout
Exporting a Setup + Layout
 - Use InventorySetupPortable
Mass exporting setups + layouts
 - Export list of InventorySetupPortables
Importing a Setup + Layout
 - Create an InventorySetupPortable which has inventory setup serializable and layout info.
 - When importing, need to add items in the setup to the tag after it's been processed, since we are only saving the layout.
 - Not supporting old format.
Add ability to export tag that core bank tags can read.
Startup of plugin
 - Upon startup, go through each processed setup.
 - If it doesn't have a layout, we will create one. Needs to be done on client thread.
 - If this is the first time using the plugin after the update (with config key), check if there is a hub bank tag layout that we can use for the layout.
 - Conversion from Hub BTL to core BTL: https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/banktags/tabs/TabInterface.java#L521
 - Use a config key to check if it is the first time using the plugin after BTL change.
 - Test with a config that has not gone through the migration and therefore has no layouts.


^^^ DONE ^^^
vvv TODO VVV


Disable Hub BTL
 - "use with inventory setups" config option turn off programmatically 
Handle Situations where Bank Tags isn't on
 - Start Bank Tags Plugin on Startup?
 - Or alternatively add a panel saying bank tags is not on, please turn it on.
 - Bug when turning on bank tags while tab is opened? Can't reproduce. Not really a concern.
 - Auto layout option in worn items needs to be hidden.
 - Chat message when trying to filter the bank.
 - Panel indicating bank tags is off and is required to use some features of inventory setups on startup.
AutoLayout and Fuzzy don't play nice


--- OTHER ---
Make sure all TODOs are taken care of
VarPlayer for quiver.

--- Findings ---
No custom mappings
ItemManager WORN_ITEMS is not public
Had to copy most of the export code for bank tag.


--- Test Cases --- 
Use a setup with quiver, bolt pouch, rune pouch, 4+ additional filtered items and potion stoarge. See if everything works. Fuzzy in spots
