Need to add a prefix to layouts
 - Add >>>invsetup<<< to indicate it comes from inventory setup plugin
 - Could use the hash afterwards? Is it worth doing that? banktags.layout_>>>invsetup<<<_<<hash>> would be the key
 - In Data manager, we can check for layouts that don't exist anymore.
   - Gather all banktags.layout* and remove ones that don't have >>>invsetup<<<.
   - Go through all inventory setups. Check if a config key for banktags.layout_>>>invsetups<<<_<hash_of_name> exists. If so, remove from the list
   - Any remaining config keys with >>>invsetups<<< must be old ones and can be deleted.
 - Function to get layout key.
Add Config Option for Default Layout
Add Preset Layout
Add ZigZag Layout
Setup Deleted
 - Remove the layout with layoutManager, Remove the tag as well
Setup Refreshed.
  - Redo the layout from scratch using preset or zigzag.
Setup Added
 - Create a layout with preset or zigzag and save it. Also create a tag.
Setup name Changed
 - Get the layout, remove the old layout and tag, and save a new layout and tag with the new name.
Helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout
 - Remove the setup tag
 - Collect all items in the inventory setup and IDs (including variation mappings if they exist).
 - Add each item to the recreated tag (be sure not to override fuzzy. If a previous item had it before we should make sure it does not get set to False)
 - Go through the existing layout and remove any IDs that are not part of the setup Ids.
 - Go through each of the setup IDs and make sure the layout has at least one copy. If not, add one to the layout.
Trim Layout helper function
Item fuzzy toggled
 - Use helper function to recalculate items in the layout as shown above.
Items Changed in a Setup
 - Need to handle removed and added.
 - Need to handle changed by slot and changed by search.
 - Additional filtered items need to be handled because they are a map instead of array.
 - I think the helper function to recalculate items in the tag + layout will take care of this as well.
   - For remove, should we remove the first instance of the item in the layout? Not currently done.
Overwrite layout
 - Add option in additional worn items to overwrite layout. Also overwrite the tag.
 - Remove tag and then recreate it. Save layout to overwrite it.
 - Add confirm option
Mass importing setups + layout
Exporting a Setup + Layout
 - Use InventorySetupPortable
Mass exporting setups + layouts
 - Export list of InventorySetupPortables
Importing a Setup + Layout
 - Create an InventorySetupPortable which has inventory setup serializable and layout info.
 - When importing, need to add items in the setup to the tag after it's been processed, since we are only saving the layout.
 - Not supporting old format.
Add ability to export tag that core bank tags can read.
Startup of plugin
 - Upon startup, go through each processed setup.
 - If it doesn't have a layout, we will create one. Needs to be done on client thread.
 - If this is the first time using the plugin after the update (with config key), check if there is a hub bank tag layout that we can use for the layout.
 - Conversion from Hub BTL to core BTL: https://github.com/runelite/runelite/blob/master/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/banktags/tabs/TabInterface.java#L521
 - Use a config key to check if it is the first time using the plugin after BTL change.
 - Test with a config that has not gone through the migration and therefore has no layouts.
Create function detecting if Hub BTL is on or CoreBTL is on - canUseLayouts()
 - banktaglayouts.useWithInventorySetups=true config key
 - pluginManager.isenabled
 - Hook into onPluginChanged and onConfigChanged to recalculate if you can use layouts
Hide Auto layout option in worn items when BTL is off or hub BTL is configured.
Handle Situations where Bank Tags isn't on
 - On startup, check if BTL is off or Hub BTL config key is set to true
 - If either is true, Add a panel warning the user with two buttons
 - Button 1: automatically configure BTL and hub key. If pressed, turn on BTL and set the key above to false
 - Button 2: Continue and do nothing.
 - Add config option to hide this warning (Explain this in the panel)

Need to update news panel
Need to update README

--- Findings ---
No custom variation mappings anymore
ItemManager WORN_ITEMS is not public
Had to copy most of the export code for bank tag.
Bug when turning on bank tags while bank is opened. Reproduce -> Bank tags is on. Log in, open bank, turn off bank tags and turn it on. Exception. Can't reproduce after.
AutoLayout and Fuzzy - Variations are sent to the top. Ask about putting them in the bottom.

--- Test Cases ---
On first time use, check if Hub BTL data properly got migrated.
Use a setup with quiver, bolt pouch, rune pouch, 4+ additional filtered items and potion stoarge. See if everything works. Fuzzy in spots.
 - Try preset layout preset
 - Try zigzag layout preset
 - Modify layout and log in and out and make sure it saves the layout
 - Try right click export button export to bank tag tab and import it into normal bank tags
 - Click export and import it into regular inventory setups and make sure layout is the same
 - Make sure stuff from potion storage works
Change setup name and make sure the layout is still the same
Change an item in a setup
Mark an item as fuzzy and unmark it as fuzzy
Remove an item in a setup
Remove a fuzzy item in a setup
Remove a rune pouch, a quiver, a bolt pouch
Replace an item with a rune pouch, with a quiver, with a bolt pouch
Add additional filtered items
Remove additional filtered items
Make sure warning layout panel does not show up more than once
Test using the rune pouch preset interface
Check some locked items that fuzzy works if possible.
Replace all items and check that all setups had their layouts adjusted.

--- Harder Tests ---
Delete a setup and make sure tags for each of the items are removed
Check that Update Panel shows up first before warning panel if layouts can't be used.
Test that an empty config doesn't crash
Remove all tags in the bank when a setup is opened and refresh it
